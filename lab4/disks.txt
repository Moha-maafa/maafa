ACTIVITY 1 – SETTING UP THE STORAGE SERVER

Create a new Linux VM
Create a linked or full clone of the Rocky Linux VM
Name it something meaningful (example: storage)

Network configuration
Place the VM on the LAN
Assign a static IP from the DHCP excluded range
Set a hostname:
hostnamectl set-hostname storage

Power off the VM
Shut down the storage VM completely

ADDING DISKS TO THE STORAGE SERVER

Add hard disks
Right-click the VM → Settings → Add → Hard Disk
Select NVMe
Select Create a new virtual disk
Set disk size to 4 GB
Click Next → Finish

Repeat disk creation
Repeat the process until 8 disks are added

Power on the VM

Verify disks
Open terminal and run:
hostname
which mdadm
date
lsblk

You should see nvme0n1 (system disk) and nvme0n2 through nvme0n9

ACTIVITY 2 – FORMATTING AND MOUNTING A DRIVE

Do NOT touch nvme0n1 (system disk)
Start with nvme0n2

Format the first data disk
Run:
mkfs -t xfs /dev/nvme0n2

Create mount point

mkdir -p /media/samba

Mount the disk
Run:
