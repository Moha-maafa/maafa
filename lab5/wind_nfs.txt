NFS ACCESS FROM WINDOWS (EXAM / LAB STYLE)

IMPORTANT NOTES
• Do this ONLY if the lab or exam explicitly asks for Windows NFS
• Linux-to-Linux NFS is more common
• Windows NFS requires UID/GID mapping (this is the key part)

PART A – WINDOWS: ENABLE NFS CLIENT

Open Control Panel

Go to
Programs → Turn Windows features on or off

Enable the following
Services for NFS
Client for NFS

Click OK

Reboot Windows
(Reboot is required)

PART B – LINUX NFS SERVER: FIND UID AND GID

On the Linux NFS server, run
stat /media/nfs1/weezer

Write down the numbers shown
Example output:
Uid: (1000/student)
Gid: (1000/student)

You need the NUMBERS only (example: 1000 and 1000).

PART C – WINDOWS: SET UID/GID IN REGISTRY

Open Registry Editor
Press:
Win + R
Type:
regedit

Navigate to
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
SOFTWARE
Microsoft
ClientForNFS
CurrentVersion
Default

Create UID entry
Right-click → New → DWORD (32-bit) Value
Name:
AnonymousUid
Value:
UID from Linux (decimal)

Create GID entry
Right-click → New → DWORD (32-bit) Value
Name:
AnonymousGid
Value:
GID from Linux (decimal)

Reboot Windows
(This step is mandatory)

PART D – WINDOWS: MOUNT NFS SHARE

Open Command Prompt as Administrator

Mount the NFS share
mount -o anon storage:/media/nfs1/weezer Z:

Notes:
storage = Linux hostname or IP
Z: = any free drive letter

Verify mount
Z:
dir

You should see files or an empty directory.

Create a test file
echo windows test > winfile.txt
dir

PART E – LINUX: VERIFY ACCESS (REQUIRED)

On the Linux server, run
ls -la /media/nfs1/weezer

Check ownership
stat /media/nfs1/weezer/winfile.txt

You must see:
• File exists
• UID and GID match what you configured
