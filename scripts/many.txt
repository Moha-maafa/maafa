🟢 OPTION 1 — rsync with built-in logging (--log-file)

(Very common, very clean)

#!/bin/bash

rsync -av --delete /home/student/ /home/student/backup/ \
  --log-file=/home/student/backup.log

What it does

Backs up /home/student and automatically writes all activity to backup.log.

📌 Source:
https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/rsync.1.html

🟢 OPTION 2 — Simple copy using tar (NO rsync)

(Sometimes taught for “archive backup”)

#!/bin/bash

tar -czf /home/student/backup.tar.gz /home/student

What it does

Creates a compressed archive of the home directory as a single backup file.

📌 Source:
https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/

🟢 OPTION 3 — cp recursive backup (VERY BASIC)

(Still acceptable if rsync not required)

#!/bin/bash

cp -r /home/student /home/student_backup

What it does

Copies the entire home directory to another directory.

⚠️ No permissions sync, no logging — but simple and valid.

📌 Source:
https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cp.1.html

🟢 OPTION 4 — rsync + timestamped log (exam favorite)
#!/bin/bash

LOG="/home/student/backup_$(date +%F).log"

rsync -av /home/student/ /home/student/backup/ >> "$LOG" 2>&1

What it does

Backs up the home directory and creates a dated log file.

📌 Source:
https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Command-Substitution.html

🟢 OPTION 5 — One-liner command (tiny quiz space)
rsync -av /home/student/ /home/student/backup/ > backup.log 2>&1

What it does

Runs a backup and saves output and errors to a log file.

🧠 HOW TO CHOOSE ON THE EXAM (IMPORTANT)
If the question says…	Use
“backup script”	Option 1
“log the backup”	Option 1 or 4
“archive”	Option 2
“simple backup”	Option 3
“one command”	Option 5



✅ OPTION 2 — dd disk or partition backup

(Seen in storage / filesystem labs)

Script
#!/bin/bash
dd if=/dev/sda1 of=/backup/sda1.img bs=4M status=progress

What it does

Creates a block-level image of a disk or partition.

⚠️ Requires root.

📚 Source:
https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dd.1.html

✅ OPTION 3 — dump filesystem backup

(Older but still exam-tested sometimes)

Script
#!/bin/bash
dump -0u -f /backup/home.dump /home

What it does

Performs a filesystem-level backup.
