Got it. Below is a clean, exam-style, step-by-step guide for GPOs, written exactly the way Lab 02 expects, no extra fluff, no guessing. This is what you would do during the exam if they say “Configure a GPO”.

Everything here is taken directly from Lab 02 – Activity 6: Creating and Linking a Group Policy Object

🛡️ GPOs — LAB 2 (EXAM STYLE)
Goal (what the exam is testing)

Create a Group Policy Object

Link it to the domain

Configure it to restrict user behavior

Verify it applies on a domain user (NOT admin)

✅ PREREQUISITES (assumed in exam)

AD, DNS, DHCP already installed

Windows Server is a Domain Controller

At least one domain user exists

Windows 11 client is joined to the domain

🔹 STEP 1 — Open Group Policy Management

On Windows Server:

Server Manager → Tools → Group Policy Management


This opens the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)

.

🔹 STEP 2 — Create and Link a GPO

Expand:

Forest → Domains → yourdomain.com


Right-click the domain

Select:

Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it here…


📌 This is critical — do NOT create it unlinked

.

🔹 STEP 3 — Name the GPO

Example (lab-style name):

DenyControlPanel


Click OK.

The GPO now appears under the domain

.

🔹 STEP 4 — Edit the GPO

Right-click the new GPO

Click Edit

🔹 STEP 5 — Configure the Policy

Navigate to:

User Configuration
 → Policies
 → Administrative Templates
 → Control Panel


Double-click:

Prohibit access to Control Panel and PC settings


Set:

Enabled


Click Apply → OK

.

🔹 STEP 6 — Apply GPO on Client

On Windows 11 client:

⚠️ Log in as a DOMAIN USER (NOT Domain Admin)

Open Command Prompt and run:

gpupdate


(or log out & log back in) 

Lab02_Instructions (2)

.

🔹 STEP 7 — Verify GPO Works

On Windows 11 (domain user):

Try to open:

Control Panel


Expected result:

“This operation has been canceled due to restrictions…”

✅ This confirms the GPO is applied 

Lab02_Instructions (2)

.

🔹 STEP 8 — (Exam Bonus) Generate GPO Report

Open PowerShell (Admin) on the server:

Get-GPOReport -Name "DenyControlPanel" -ReportType HTML -Path C:\DenyCP.html


Open the HTML file and verify:

Details

Links

Settings

This is required for the lab report and commonly tested

🧠 EXAM TIPS (VERY IMPORTANT)

GPOs do not apply to Domain Admins

GPOs apply based on where they are linked

User Configuration → affects users

Computer Configuration → affects machines

If it doesn’t work → run:

gpupdate /force

🏁 ONE-LINE EXAM SUMMARY

Created and linked a GPO at the domain level, configured a user policy to restrict Control Panel access, and verified enforcement on a domain user workstation.

If you want, next we can:

Do desktop wallpaper GPO (also in Lab 2)

Or practice “what would the exam ask” GPO scenarios
